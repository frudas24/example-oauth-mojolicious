=========================

Examples of both OAuth 1.0a consumer and service provider using Net::OAuth through Mojolicious::Lite.

The service provider example uses MongoDB simply for storage of nonces and tokens/secrets.

Tested to be working with Net::OAuth 0.28, Mojolicious 2.98, and MongoDB 0.45.
